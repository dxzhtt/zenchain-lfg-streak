# ZenChain LFG Streak

Welcome to **ZenChain LFG Streak**! This is a fun and simple web-based game inspired by the vibrant LFG (Let's Fucking Go) culture of the ZenChain community. Players can say "LFG" every day to build their streak, stored locally using browser's localStorage. With a sleek dark-themed UI, a responsive 1000x1000 GIF, and clear, bold text, this project is crafted with love to bring energy and excitement to your daily routine. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's fully optimized for both web and mobile devices. 

We hope this project sparks joy and motivates you to keep the LFG spirit alive! ðŸš€

## Features

- Resets streak if a day is missed, keeping the challenge alive.
- Dark-themed UI with a black background (#121212) for a modern look.
- Responsive GIF (scaled to 200px on desktop, 150px on mobile) that blends seamlessly.
- High-contrast text for excellent readability on all devices.
- Deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access.
